What should the calculator app look like?

    Initial approach

Its single page so need for a nav bar too cause you are not navigating anywhere.

first you input your details
User Details are: Name,Age, School, level
GPA data details: what semester, number of courses that semsester: this would then create a courswe table with the exact number of roles you put for number of courses.
The GPA Table The first column would be courses, second would be total score over 100, 3rd would be an automatic grade score set based on the total score. By default the grade score would be set based on my school(Bacock University standards), but you can customize it to your schools own if its not the same grading system your school is using. E.g in BU 70 is Grade A in your school 70 could be B so to change that just click on the customize button on the head of that column and it would show a like form or whatever where you set the intervals for the score for your preference. Then the next colum would be credit Unit, the the next would be the GP for that course.
AT the bottom It would calculate CGPA and GPA based on the data in the table and siplay your GP is: and your CGPA is:
Then there would be a add new semester button that you can add a completely new GPA data details but the CGPA would be the same but the GP would be reset to zero for that new semester. Then your CGPA would be the addition of the last GP plus the new GP divided by the total number of Gps.

now

Well as expected during the brainstorming phase of development new ideas started to spring to mind and now i am adding and removing a lot more feautures than before.
